# Climate Collab
- My turtle hack project. A web app whichs helps calculate carbon footprints among groups of people.

# How I built it
- The project is built with mongoDb atlas as the database 
- It is built with python Flask as the backend server side code 
- The front end it built with the react js framework

# How it is currently being built
- working on a version that better utilizes reacts router dom 
- working on adding more options to input personal climate data
- working on backend calculations for that data

# What is next 
- I aim to expand the project overtime and add new features. 
- I aim to include more detailed results by gathering more data 
- This will be made optional in many cases to still make the application accessable to users
- I aim to include more online features so users can interact wiht each other to work to help the enviorment 
- I aim to expand beyond just carbon footprint and make the app a more enviormental protection application 
- I aim to explore the community aspect of the app more
